## The LZComplex package handles the math of complex numbers.

var c = LZComplex(re: 2, im: 4)
print(c) // gives 2 + 4i

## List of operations:

| Operation | Result |
| ------ | ------ |
| c** | the square of c |
| log(c) | natural log of c |
| c^3 | power 3 of c |
| c1^c2 | powr c2 of c1 |
| c1 + c2 | addition |
| c1 - c2 | subtraction |
| c1 * c2 | multiplication |
| c1 / c2 | division |
| -c1 | negative |
| abs(c) | modulus of c |
| sqrt(c) | root square of c |
| c* | coniugate of c |
| c1 += c2 | c1 = c1 + c2 |
| c1 -= c2 | c1 = c1 - c2 |
| c1 *= c2 | c1 = c1 * c2 |
| c1 /= c2 | c1 = c1 / c2 |
